# Bonus assignment

We want to fill the table with some initial data. There a service function 'getData' which can reject in 50% of times.

1. You will need to try to fetch the data until it succeeds. The pause between retries should be 0.5 seconds
2. While we try to load the data, show a loading message instead of the table
3. While we try to load the data, the form and the "Submit" button should be disabled
4. Once we fetch the data, the table should start displaying it
